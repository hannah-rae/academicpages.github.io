I am currently an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research focuses on developing machine learning solutions for remote sensing applications in agricultural monitoring, food security, and Earth/planetary science. I am the Machine Learning Lead and U.S. Domestic Co-Lead for [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/), NASAâ€™s food security initiative run out of the University of Maryland.

I did my Ph.D. at Arizona State University on machine learning methods (especially novelty detection) for planetary exploration missions. I received my B.S. in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I conducted research on 3D motion planning for autonomous agents. I have worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, and Langley Research Center, as well as the commercial remote sensing company Planet, Inc. I am passionate about advancing opportunities for black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) and women in computer science and devote much of my time outside of research to these efforts.

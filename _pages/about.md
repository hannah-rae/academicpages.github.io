I am currently an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Maryland. My research focuses on developing **machine learning** solutions for a variety of **remote sensing** applications in **agricultural monitoring**, **food security**, and **scientific discovery**. I am part of the [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/) program coordinated by the University of Maryland Center for Global Agricultural Monitoring Research in the Department of Geographical Sciences.

I completed my PhD at Arizona State University, during which I developed machine learning (primarily deep learning) methods to facilitate scientific discovery in planetary exploration missions at Mars, the Moon, and Earth. I worked mostly with remote sensing data of **Mars** collected by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). These data include multispectral, color, and panchromatic images as well as nuclear spectroscopy data.

I received my B.S. in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I have worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, and Langley Research Center, as well as the commercial remote sensing company Planet, Inc. I am passionate about advancing opportunities for women and under-represented individuals in computer science and devote much of my time outside of research to these efforts.

I am currently an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Maryland. My research focuses on developing **machine learning** solutions for a variety of **remote sensing** applications in **agricultural monitoring**, **food security**, and **scientific discovery**. I am part of the [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/) program coordinated by the University of Maryland Center for Global Agricultural Monitoring Research in the Department of Geographical Sciences.

My additional research interests are in developing methods for facilitating scientific discovery in **planetary exploration** missions at Mars, the Moon, and Earth, including the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity and Mars 2020 rovers. I work with multispectral, color, and panchromatic imaging as well as nuclear spectroscopy instruments.

I received my B.S. in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I have worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, and Langley Research Center, as well as the commercial remote sensing company Planet, Inc. I am passionate about advancing opportunities for women and under-represented individuals in computer science and devote much of my time outside of research to these efforts.

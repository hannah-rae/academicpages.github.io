My research focus is on **machine learning** solutions to **remote sensing** challenges. In my current research at Arizona State University, I am developing machine learning and deep learning methdos to facilitate scientific discovery in planetary exploration missions, especially those at **Mars**. I am also interested in analysis of Earth geospatial data that helps improve the quality of life for people everywhere, and how this analysis can be used to prevent/mitigate crimes against humanity and natural disasters.

Currently, I work mostly with remote sensing data of Mars collected by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). These data include multispectral, color, and panchromatic images as well as time-domain spectra. Much of my work leverages unsupervised approaches learn salient relationships in large volumes of complex, unlabeled data that I combine with supervised approaches to reduce requirements for domain-expert labeled data.

I received my Ph.D. in exploration systems design from Arizona State University and my B.S. in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I have worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, and Langley Research Center, as well as the commercial remote sensing company Planet, Inc. I am passionate about advancing opportunities for women and under-represented individuals in computer science and devote much of my time outside of research to these efforts.

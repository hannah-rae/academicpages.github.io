“Mastcam” is a pair of multispectral, color CCD imagers mounted on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover’s mast. Scientists typically have less than 12 hours after data is received from the rover to plan follow-up observations, and will have at most 5 hours for Mastcam-Z on Mars 2020. There is a need for systems that can rapidly and intelligently extract information from Mastcam and other science instrument data to prioritize potential discoveries and avoid missed science opportunities. We are continously developing a novelty detection system called Selections based on Autoencoder Modeling of Multispectral Image Expectations (SAMMIE) that focuses scientists’ attention on the most promising observations and provides explanations for its detections.

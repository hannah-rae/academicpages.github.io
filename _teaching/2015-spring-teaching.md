I designed and taught this course in an effort to introduce the beauty and joy of computer science to students who might not have considered majoring in CS due to a lack of experience or confidence. This course was inspired by the diversity and inclusion efforts of UC Berkeley and Harvey Mudd College. Dr. Kevin Jeffay mentored me throughout this process. I taught introductory concepts for several areas of computer science including artificial intelligence and object-oriented programming. This course had a final project at the end in which students worked in small groups to design a tool of their choosing using at least one external python library.

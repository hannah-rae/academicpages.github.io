Girls Who Code is an organization that facilitates free summer and after-school programs to teach girls how to code and about career paths in computer science. I have taught 6-8th grade girls at Maie B. Heard Elementary in Phoenix, AZ since 2016. In addition to programming exercises, the students work on an impact project of their choice and design each year. [Here is one of their projects](http://heardgwc.weebly.com), in which they sought to improve the quality and nutrition of the lunches at their school.
